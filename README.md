# TTG Tools by Den Em and Pashok6798

TTG Tools is a powerful utility for modifying files from Telltale Games, including texts (.landb, .langdb, and .dlog for *Sam & Max*, and .prop containing texts in *The Walking Dead*), textures (.d3dtx) for PC, Xbox 360, PS4, PS3, and Nintendo Switch, fonts (.font), as well as extracting and creating archive files (.ttarch and .ttarch2). It also allows decryption of .lua and .lenc files used by Telltale Games.
